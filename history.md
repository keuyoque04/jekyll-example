The Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry has stood for over a thousand years. 
Founded by Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin, 
the castle holds centuries of magical tradition, mysteries, and legendary tales. 
Visitors can explore the Great Hall, hidden passageways, and portraits that whisper the 
stories of its enchanted past.

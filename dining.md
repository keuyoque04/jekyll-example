The Great Hall offers a magical dining experience where meals appear as if by spell. 
Feast on pumpkin pasties, treacle tarts, and a full English breakfast.  

For a sweet treat, stop by Honeydukes in Hogsmeade, or enjoy a warm Butterbeer at the Three Broomsticks.

The beautiful lighting comes from our candles which float right above the hall
